# BioSwift

## An open source framework for bioinformatics written in Swift

### This repository is:
- pure educational
- subject to major changes
- supported for macOS and iOS

### This repository is not:
- complete
- tested
- intended to be used in production

### The BioSwift framework currently provides:
- creation of Protein objects from an input string
- residue modifications from the unimod database
- find subsequences
- molecular weight calculations
- digestion of proteins
- fragmentation of peptides
- reads fasta files

### TODO:
- sequence manipulations
- sequence calculations (chemical and physical properties)
- import of UniProt files
- support for dna and rna sequences

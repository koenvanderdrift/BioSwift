 Introduction and history

 The Mongo Oligo Mass Calculator is a tool for calculating masses of oligonucleotides and fragments obtained by collision induced dissociation (CID) or enzymatic digests.
 Mongo Oligo was a program, originally written in Fortran on a MAC by Pat Limbach, Steven Pomerantz and Jef Rozenski. The current version is rewritten for JavaScript 1.1. In order to let all the functions of this program work, you need to enable JavaScript in the settings of your web browser.
 The current version includes mass calculation of oligonucleotides, CID fragments, endo- and exonuclease digestion. It contains extra output options and utilities for handling the input sequence and user residue assignment. Also, an extensive help is provided.

 Sequence

 A sequence should be entered in the input window starting from 5' end down to the 3' end of the oligonucleotide.
 Modified residues can be entered using one letter codes as defined in the tRNA database [1].
 DNA2RNA
 Use this button to convert the sequence from DNA to the complementary RNA counterpart. Modified residues are ignored.
 RNA2DNA
 Use this button to convert the sequence from RNA to the complementary DNA counterpart. Modified residues are ignored.
 Cleanup
 Allows the user to remove all characters from the sequence that are not A, C, G, T, or U.
 Clear Sequence
 Removes the sequence in the input window.

 Calculation

 Molecular mass
 This option calculates the mass for an entered sequence. Depending on the setting of the monoisotopic/average mass option, the corresponding mass values will be used. Check the selections of the 3' and 5' terminal ends and oligonucleotide type (DNA or RNA).
 Electrospray series
 Electrospray ionization generates multiple charge states of oligonucleotides. This calculation will give the m/z values for the sequence entered together with the sodium and potassium cation adducts, commonly present in oligonucleotide spectra.
 CID fragments
 When oligonucleotides fragment in a collision cell of a mass spectrometer, mainly 2 types of ions are generated (see [2]). The cleavage of a 3'C - 3'O bond yields a fragment with the 3' oligonucleotide end that contains a phosphate at the 5' end and is called the w ion. When a heterocyclic base is lost with the cleavage of the 3'C -3'O bond, the part containing the 5' end of the oligonucleotide is called the a-B ion. If the 'extended output' option is checked, additional fragment ion types will be calculated. For the complete nomenclature see ref. [1].
 Internal fragments
 These are fragments resulting from a double backbone cleavage. They have a phosphate at their 5' end and a furan at the 3' terminal. The calculations are limited to the maximum charge state of (+ or -) 5 or (+ or -) 1 for non-sorted and sorted output respectively.
 Base losses
 The intact oligonucleotide can loose a base anion (B-) or a neutral base (B+H). The anions are more likely to be lost from highly charged oligonucleotides due to electrostatic repulsion.
 RNase T1 digest
 Selection of this calulation will give all fragments obtained by T1 digestion of the oligonucleotide entered. RNase T1 is an endonuclease that cuts RNA at the 3' end of every G in the chain, resulting in a fragment ending on Gp or G>p depending on the reaction conditions. Both possibilities are calculated. The mass of the fragments is also calculated. In the output window of an enzymatic digest, clicking on a partial sequence will transfer the data to the input window, so that additional calculations for that partial sequence can be performed.
 RNase U2 digest
 RNase U2 is an endonuclease that cuts RNA mainly at the 3' end of an A in the chain. For this enzyme both the 3'p and 3'>p ends are calculated.
 RNase A digest
 RNase A is an endonuclease cutting at pyrimidines. Fragments are calculated having a C or U at the 3' end. For this enzyme also both the 3'p and 3'>p ends are calculated.
 5' and 3' exonuclease digest
 These enzymes attack the oligo from the 5' or 3' end and release one nucleotide at the time. The masses of the remaining oligonucleotide chain is calculated baginning with the starting sequence.
 Modified RNA list
 This item gives a list of all currently available modified nucleotides, their codes, the base masses and eventually the sugar modification value. Depending on the setting of the parameter 'average/monoisotopic mass', the corresponding masses will be shown. If the option 'sorted' is checked, the values are printed according to the base masses. Clicking on the one-character code of the modification will transfer you to the corresponding entry in the RNA modification database [3].
 The one-letter codes are taken from the tRNA database [1].
 Some calculations are restricted to oligonucleotides not exceeding a certain length in order to prevent memory overflow. See the table hereafter for the current specifications.

 Options

 average/monoisotopic mass
 The appropriate mass selection (average/monoisotopic) should be selected depending on the type of apparatus used or on the purpose of calculation. For more information see ref. []
 negative/positive mode
 Depending on the acquisition mode, positively or negatively charged ions should be considered. This can be set by this option. It does not affect the value of the molecular mass, which is allways the mass of the neutral species.
 DNA/RNA
 The choice of the oligonucleotide type: deoxyribonucleotide (DNA) of ribonucleotide (RNA) determines the sugar type that will be used in the calculations.
 allow undercut
 If this option is checked, also undercut pieces will be calculated for enzymatic digests.
 back to menu
 Terminals

 Select the desired terminal on the 5' end and on the 3' end. The most common occurences are provided. If other groups shoul be present at the terminal ends, use 'user defined residue "N"'.
 back to menu
 Memories

 Sequences can be temporarily stored in one of the 5 available memory locations. Use this feature before taking actions that could affect the sequence in the sequence window (e.g. cleanup, digest followed by CID calculation). Follow these steps:
 Select a memory location (1..5).
 Hit the copy button. The sequence (or the first part if the sequence is long) will appear in the selection window.
 Perform the desired actions.
 To restore a previously stored sequence, hit the paste button.
 Clear all will empty all memory locations.
 back to menu
 User residue 'N'

 A user defined residue, represented by the symbol 'N' in the sequence can be set up by entering the base anion mass and the sugar modification mass. The sugar modification mass represents the mass to be added to an unmodified sugar residue (e.g. for a 2'-O-Me sugar, average mass, type here the value 14.027, corresponding to an addition of CH2).
 This feature can also be used to define a modified terminal (by setting the appropriate sugar modification mass).
 back to menu
 Output

 Close button
 When the 'calculate' button is hit, a new window will be opened if not yet open. This output window will contain the results for the calculations. By default, a 'close' button is provided in order to enable the user easily to close the output window. If that button is not desired (e.g. for printing purposes), simply uncheck the 'close button' option.
 Output summary
 Checking this option will also output the sequence, the terminals, composition and other settings.
 Sequence by
 This options allows the sequence to be printed in sets of 3, 10 or 50 residues for readability.
 Extended output
 If this option is checked, some extra calculations will be included. See following table:
 Calculation    Extended output will add
 Molecular mass
 Electrospray series    sodium and potassium adducts
 CID fragments    y and d-H2O ions
 internal fragments
